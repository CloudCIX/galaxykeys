Galaxy Key Generator

If you consider the entire installed base of the CloudCIX Platform as a Universe, then each connected group of Pods is called a Galaxy. Each Galaxy consistes of up to 255 Pods.

One critical attribute of the CloudCIX Platform Security is that Public and Private Key pairs are used throughout and there is zero dependency on passwords. The recommended strategy for generating and maintaining these Keys is to use a GnuPG protected pass register.

The bash script in this project pregenerates the entire set of keys required for a Galaxy.
